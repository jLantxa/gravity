# gravity

Simple and stupid gravity simulator written just out of curiosity. For this to compile and run properly on your machine you need to install SDL2 and SDL2_gfx.


Controls:

F: Toggle fullscreen if enabled in your build
G: Toogle gravitational field view
P: Pause simulation
R: Reset universe (erase all particles)

Left click: Add a planet (drag to set the initial velocity of the particle)
Right click: Add a black hole
L_SHIFT + Right Click: Add white hole

ESC: Exit fullscreen or exit the game when in window mode
